Welcome to my coding challenge submission.
Run 'main.py' to play the game.
Click the PLAY button and EASY or HARD, and then type in the letters that you think fill the word.
Thanks for playing!

This project uses the https://random-word-api.vercel.app/ API.
If it doesn't work, then the code picks a different word.
ENVIRONMENT
import:
pygame-ce 2.5.5
requests

The code is very unoptimized, but it should work just fine.
